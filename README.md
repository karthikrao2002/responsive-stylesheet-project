# Responsive Stylesheet Project

This project demonstrates a responsive layout using media queries. It adjusts the width of divs and images for different screen sizes:

- **Mobile View:** Default layout.
- **Tablet View (≥772px):** Divs become 45% width, images limited to 30% height.
- **Large Screen View (≥998px):** Divs become 30% width.

## Instructions
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Resize the window to see layout changes.
3. Validate with W3C and WAVE tools.

## Hosting
Host your project and submit the link for peer review.
